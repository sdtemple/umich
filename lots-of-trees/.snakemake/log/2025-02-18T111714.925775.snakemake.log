ImproperOutputException in rule vcf_to_zarr in file /mnt/c/Users/sethd/Work/umich/lots-of-trees/rules/vcf.smk, line 33:
Outputs of incorrect type (directories when expecting files or vice versa). Output directories must be flagged with directory(). for rule vcf_to_zarr:
    output: data/0/simulated.zarr
    wildcards: folder=data, sim_id=0
    affected files:
        data/0/simulated.zarr
Removing output files of failed job vcf_to_zarr since they might be corrupted:
data/0/simulated.zarr
Skipped removing non-empty directory data/0/simulated.zarr
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
