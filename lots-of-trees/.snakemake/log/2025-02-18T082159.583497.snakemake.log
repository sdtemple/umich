MissingOutputException in rule access_tree in file /mnt/c/Users/sethd/Work/umich/lots-of-trees/rules/trees.smk, line 13:
Job 57  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
data/5/0/lcr.trees (missing locally, parent dir contents: center.tree.pkl, init.txt, left.tree.pkl, right.tree.pkl)
Removing output files of failed job access_tree since they might be corrupted:
data/5/0/center.tree.pkl, data/5/0/left.tree.pkl, data/5/0/right.tree.pkl
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
